The EbitSim is an enhanced BitTorrent simulation with the
following features:

- Multiple concurrent swarm
- Multiple trackers
- Timeslice processing model
- A thousand nodes simulated
- Use of the INET Framework
- Modular model to allow easy configuration

For now, this model does not come with documentation other
than the comments on the code. Check the article with the
same name, presented at MASCOTS 201, for further information.

This code was built with omnetpp-4.2 and it needs an
installation of inet-20111118. When compiling, don't forget
to run 'make' inside the folder src/client/smc.

It is highly recommended that you use the OMNeT++ IDE that
comes with the installation.

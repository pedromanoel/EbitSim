The EbitSim is an enhanced BitTorrent simulation with the
following features:

- Multiple concurrent swarm
- Multiple trackers
- Timeslice processing model
- A thousand nodes simulated
- Use of the INET Framework
- Modular model to allow easy configuration

For now, this model does not come with documentation other
than the comments on the code. Check the article with the
same name, presented at MASCOTS 2011, for further information.

DEPENDENCIES

This code was built with omnetpp-4.2.2 and it needs an
installation of inet-20111118.

They both can be found at the links:
http://www.omnetpp.org/omnetpp
http://inet.omnetpp.org/

Extract omnetpp and inet in a folder of your choice, where the
omnetpp workspace will be created ("~/Workspace", for example).

In a fresh Ubuntu install, it is necessary to install the
following packages to compile omnetpp:
- default-jre
- build-essential
- zlib1g-dev
- tcl8.4-dev
- tk8.4-dev
- tclreadline
- blt-dev
- libxml2-dev
- libpcap-dev

Run the following command to install these packages
$ sudo apt-get install default-jre build-essential zlib1g-dev tcl8.4-dev\
 tk8.4-dev tclreadline blt-dev libxml2-dev libpcap-dev

In order to compile Ebitsim, it is necessary to download the smc and boost libraries:
SMC: http://smc.sourceforge.net/
Boost: http://www.boost.org/

Extract them somewere in your home folder, such as "~/libs".

INSTALLATION

1. Compile omnetpp-4.2.2 by running the following commands:
$ ./configure
$ make

If you face any problems, please refer to the omnetpp installation guide.

2. Install the smc
Create the file "~/bin/smc" with the following content:
#!/bin/bash
if [[ $# > 0 ]]
then
    java -jar PATH-TO-SMC-INSTALL/bin/Smc.jar $*
else
    echo "Usage: smc -{targetlanguage} {options} {smfilename}.sm"
fi

Substitute PATH-TO-SMC-INSTALL with the path where you extracted the smc
("~/libs/smc_VERSION" if you followed the suggestion above).

3. Compile the inet framework and the EBitSim project
Open the omnetpp IDE and add the projects EBitSim and inet to the workspace.
If you followed the suggestion from this guide, they should be at "~/Workspace".
Run 'make' inside the folder src/client/smc.
Compile both projects and you're set to go!
